    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <br>
      <p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at VIT CHENNAI.</p>

      <p>I have a foundational understanding of machine learning, which includes knowledge of basic algorithms and data
         preprocessing techniques. I am also exploring the exciting and evolving 
        field of quantum computing, particularly focusing on introductory concepts and tools for quantum learning.</p>

      <p>I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python, which enables me to approach 
        problems with flexibility and confidence.</p>

      <p>As I progress through my academic journey, I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world problems through internships, 
        collaborative projects, or research opportunities.</p>

      <img src="images/p1.jpeg" alt="Quantum Autonomous Vehicle Project" width="300px" height="200px">
      <h3>Quantum-Powered Decision System for Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
      <p>This project explores the integration of quantum algorithms into autonomous vehicle systems to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. Using quantum-inspired optimization and simulation models, the aim was to increase accuracy in real-time obstacle avoidance and route optimization under computational constraints.</p>

      <img src="images/traffic.png" alt="Traffic Sign Detector" width="300px" height="200px">
      <h3>Traffic Sign Detector</h3>
      <p>Traffic sign detection using machine learning (ML) involves recognizing and classifying road signs from still images.
         The process starts by collecting and labeling images 
         of various traffic signs, such as stop, speed limit, or pedestrian crossing signs.  Once trained, the model can identify traffic 
         signs from new images under different lighting or weather conditions. This helps vehicles understand road rules and improves 
         safety.</p>

      <div><h3>Research Intern in VIT</h3> <br> </div>

      <div>
        <p>I completed a research internship at my reputed college, where I gained valuable exposure to the fundamentals of academic 
        research. During this period, I actively participated in various stages of the research process, including data handling,
         literature review, and collaborative discussions with mentors. The experience enhanced my analytical thinking, attention 
         to detail, and reinforced my enthusiasm for research and continuous learning.</p>
